* 1__ Why are you interested in programming?__ ... __What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?__ ...
........I have always been interested in how things work.my uncle worked for IBM and my mother before she passed was teaching herself C. I have written some macros for gaming in WoW. And I have adjusted programming for test sets that were written in basic sent from the Uk.

* 2__What are your professional goals in the next 2 year,5 years?__
..... My professional goal are in flux in 2 years I hope I have left the limiting employment of electronic manufacturing and have fully made the transition to programming in 5 year I hope to be working from where ever I choose (one does not need to be in an office to create good works) with a group of innovative out of the box individuals

* 3__ Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encounter the situation again, what would you do differently 
.......we had to move to a bigger house and we left Purcellville VA to move to a small country town Boyce. This was a mistake (1 of many, Murphy lives in my back pocket) the trade off was twice the distance to work no public transportation a huge yard with not enough time to do the work. I have learned to consider even the smallest things when making changes because what looks like no big deal at first may become the elephant in your back yard.

4. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe how you approached it. I taught my self fine wood working. I read many articles and asked sever people for advice. My big project was a table for my father with no screw or nails or glues. I was told it could not be done. I asked why not?I was told by another I asked for advice from that it just wasn't done they way. I said why not? our discussions of the reasons the methods chosen wouldn't work we proved indeed it could be done.
